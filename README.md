Why I Created This,
Growing up surrounded by stories, 
I’ve always been fascinated by
how cinema brings people together—across
generations, cultures, and emotions. This
project is my way of blending my tech-savvy 
side with a deep love for vintage Bollywood.
It’s an ongoing adventure, diving into the 
classics that defined an era. And honestly? 
It’s just pure fun to create something
that celebrates the timeless charm of
Indian cinema
